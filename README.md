Controls
  - Arrow Keys: Moves character
  - Space: Jump
  - W: Attack 1
    - Pressing W once will use the sweep attack, greatest range, best for large groups of projectiles, using sweep in air will grant you additional airtime
    - Pressing W multiple times will use reflect, reverse the motion of projectiles
  - D: Attack 2
    - Pressing D once will use slash, decent range, better than spam
    - Spamming D for dear life as you struggle to get any projectiles will use spam, poor range, decent at getting groups, requires more accuracy than other longer range attacks, spamming in air will grant a small increase to airtime
  - Killing enemies in air grants you another jump, these can be chained together to give increased speed at a loss to accuracy
  - Press F11 to go into fullscreen mode for best experience
